# 📊 Financial Operations KPI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Financial Operations KPI Dashboard** to analyze and visualize key financial investment patterns, preferences, and operational metrics. Using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, Streamlit)**, the dashboard provides insights into **investment avenues, savings objectives, monitoring frequency, and expected returns**.  

The project demonstrates skills in **data cleaning, feature engineering, KPI calculation, interactive dashboards, and data storytelling** — all highly relevant for a **Data Analyst role** in the financial industry.
